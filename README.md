# sens2

This is a PHP/Javascript system for assisting schools with managing SEN provision.
You will need a webserver and mysql to use this system.

The entire system is free to use, and we offer support and installation help to schools who would like to try it out.
We are also able to give references to SenCos who currently use this system to manage SEN provision.
